# telescope-scheduling-tool
With the [STScI Space Astronomy Summer Program (SASP)](https://www.stsci.edu/opportunities/space-astronomy-summer-program), I developed software for the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) SPIKE observation scheduling systems. Specifically, I created [a dynamic visualization tool](observation_constraint_visualization.html){:target="_blank"} for the analysis of temporal scheduling constraints, as primarily used by SPIKE Developers and SPIKE Users. The tool is designed to be lightweight (fast, computationally inexpensive), interactive (supporting zooming, scrolling, dynamic time information displays), and independent (producing a stand-alone web page) for optimized functionality and communication among users. Documentation for this tool can be found [here](tool-documentation.pdf) and my Summer Student Symposium presentation can be found [here](https://cloudproject.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=3ffd29cd-8277-4512-bb1c-a996002cda01) at time 55:20 - 1:04:34.
